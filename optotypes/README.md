# Optotypes
This folder contains all optotypes available for use with the `optotype` visual acuity chart type in `charts.xml`. To create a calibrated optotype you must ensure that the size of the optotype adheres to the rule of 100 pixels being equal to 1 arc minute at a 6 meter distance to the patient.

Furthermore, each optotype should include an SVG named `_.svg`. The width of this SVG defines the width between each optotype letter in a chart.

See the included optotypes for examples.

The optotypes included with VisuTest are all created with the open source vector graphics software Inkscape:
